# Cognitive Impairment Prediction

This repository contains scripts for Cognitive Impairment prediction using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.

## Description

- **Random Forest Model**: This model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to predict Cognitive Impairment based on the provided data. It's suitable for complex data and can provide accurate predictions.

- **Logistic Regression Model**: The Logistic Regression model is used to predict Cognitive Impairment by modeling the relationship between the target variable and predictor variables. It's a simple yet effective method for classification tasks.

## Usage

1. First, run the main script to preprocess the data and for data visualization:
   ```shell
   Rscript main.R

2. Random Forest Model: To train and evaluate the Random Forest model, run:
   ```shell
   Rscript RandomForest.R

3. Logistic Regression Model: To train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model, run:
   ```shell
   Rscript LogisticRegression.R
